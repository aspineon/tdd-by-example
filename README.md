Test-Driven Development
=======================

Code guided by Kent Beck's book Test-Driven Development by Example. Implemented in Ruby, instead of Java, for the first part and, as in the book, in Python for the second.

Commits in the Git graph represents chapters. Two different branches are two parts of the books.

To run the test for a specific chapter checkout its commit and run

```
./test
```

_N.B. If you aren't using OS X or wish to supress voice test result reporting, remove `&&` part in the `test` file._
